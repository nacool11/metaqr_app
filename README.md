## 📱 Overview

**MetaQR** is a cross-platform Flutter mobile app built for microbiome researchers, clinicians, and students. By scanning microbiome-derived QR codes, users can access functional profiles, annotations, and risk scores—backed by a powerful FastAPI backend with machine learning capabilities.

This project bridges biological datasets with user-friendly mobile visualizations.
